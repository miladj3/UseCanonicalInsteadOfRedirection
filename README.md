# canonical instead of a redirection


One of the methods for improved the performance of this website is Use canonical instead of a redirection.
In some case you could also replace the redirection by adding a canonical header or tag to the page (<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/page1" />). In this case the search engines will index the page correctly, and the users avoid one redirection. If you want the user to see the expected url, you can rewrite the url using the history api.
